/*
There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the
amount of gas at station i is gas[i]. 

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i]
of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You
begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. 

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around
the circuit once, otherwise return -1. 

Note:
 The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
