/*
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains 
a label and a list of its neighbors. 

OJ's undirected graph serialization: 
Nodes are labeled uniquely. We use # as a separator for each
node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor 
of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}. 

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains 
three parts as separated by #. 
1.First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1
  and 2.
2.Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
3.Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself),
  thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following: 

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
         \_/
