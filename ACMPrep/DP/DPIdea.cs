/*
Step 1: Structure   
 * Characterize the structure of an optimal solution

 * Decompose the problem into smaller problems, and find a relation
 * between the structure of the optimal solution of the original problem
 * and the solution of the smaller problems.

Step 2: Principle of Optimality    
 * Recursively define the value of an optimal solution

 * Express the solution of the original problem in terms of optimal solutions
 * for smaller problems

Step 3: Bottom-up computation
 * Compute the value of an optimal solution in a bottom-up fashion by using 
 * a table structure

Step 4: Construction of optimal solution
 * Construct an optimal solution from computed information
