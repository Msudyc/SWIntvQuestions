/*
Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How 
many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively 
in the grid.

For example,

There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as 
illustrated below.

[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]

The total number of unique paths is 2.

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(List<List<int> > &obstacleGrid) {
        
    }
};
